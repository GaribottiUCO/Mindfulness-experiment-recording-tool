# Mindfulness-experiment-recording-tool
We would like a tool with which to collect data resulting from the following mindfulness experiment:   Participants will be asked to focus on their breathing for a duration of 10 minutes. When the participant notices that their attention has wandered from their breathing, they are to indicate this by pressing a key. Additionally, the participants will be prompted regarding their attention at random moments throughout the experiment. If their attention has wandered, they will report this through use of a different key. After the 10 minutes have elapsed, the participant will be notified and the collected data will be transmitted to the experimenters. The 10-minute trials will be conducted once a day for a number of days.  The experiment will be conducted in the participants' home using a "standard" computer having a physical keyboard; i.e. a desktop or laptop computer as opposed to a mobile device such as a phone or tablet.
