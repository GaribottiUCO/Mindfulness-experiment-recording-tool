That explains how to mark a work with a CC license

I suggested her to use the BY-NC-SA license

Basically that abbreviation means, that everyone using your work:

must cite you as original author
must not use your work for earning money
must publish his own work (based on yours) with the same license.

There is also the possibility to forbid derivative works, i.e. people
can only redistribute your work as it is, but this not your case.
